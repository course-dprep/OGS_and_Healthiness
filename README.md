# The Impact of Online Grocery Shopping (OGS) on the Healthiness of Households’ Food Purchases

## Motivation

The demand for healthier food consumption has increased significantly in recent years. For many households, supermarket retailers are still the primary source for their food purchases. By shaping the environment in
which purchasing decisions are made, retailers play a crucial role in the forming of consumers’ food purchasing
behavior and habits. Recent literature has investigated how the healthiness of online grocery purchases differs from offline (in-store) purchases (Chintala et al, 2024; Harris-Lagoudakis, 2022; Huyghe et al, 2017).
While online grocerybaskets tend to be healthier compared to offline baskets, it is unclear if the adoption of OGS contributes to
healthier consumption or if it results in a redistribution across channels, where consumers simply shift the
more healthy purchases online and purchase unhealthy products mainly offline. More research is needed that
examines how households alternate between online and offline shopping trips and how they allocate their
purchases across both channels. As such, the central question in this project is:

*How does the transition to hybrid grocery shopping affect the healthiness of food purchases across both online
and offline grocery channels?*

## Method and results

The formal analysis examines how the healthiness of households’ grocery baskets changes once they start
shopping in online channels in addition to their in-store purchases. We will employ a Difference-in-Difference
(DiD) approach to compare the changes in healthiness of grocery baskets for households that transition to
hybrid shopping against those that continue shopping exclusively offline. This approach allows for controlling
for general trends that affect all households (e.g. COVID-19 pandemic). By using a DiD model, we can isolate
the effect that OGS has on the healthiness of households’ grocery food purchases.
