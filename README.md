# Note:

For this project I am not using publicly downloadable data. Rather, I have created a (anonymized) sample dataset from the data that I am using for my PhD project.
Because this dataset is not downloadable through a public https adress, I have created this branch where the data will be uploaded.
In the main branch of this repository, the Makefile will create a ../../data directory and download the data from this branch.
