# The Impact of Online Grocery Shopping on the Healthiness of Households’ Food Purchases
## Project Data preparation & workflow management - Fall 2024 - Team 14

### Research motivation
The demand for healthier food consumption has increased significantly in recent years. For many households, supermarket retailers are still the primary source for their food purchases. By shaping the environment in
which purchasing decisions are made, retailers play a crucial role in the forming of consumers’ food purchasing
behavior and habits. Over the past decade, there has been a noticeable rise in Online Grocery Shopping
(OGS), and the adoption of OGS has significantly accelerated since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Recent literature has investigated how the healthiness of online grocery purchases differs from offline (in-store) purchases (Chintala et al, 2024; Harris-Lagoudakis, 2022; Huyghe et al, 2017). This research generally
finds that online shopping baskets tend to be healthier compared to offline baskets. Yet, these studies often
neglect the fact that households that adopt OGS may be different from households that do not, and that their
shopping baskets may be healthier to begin with. Second, they also neglect the fact that most households
that shop online still buy the majority of their groceries in physical stores. These households are called hybrid
shoppers, which implies that they utilize both online and offline shopping channels to make their purchases.
Consequently, there is a gap in our understanding regarding the impact of OGS on the overall healthiness
of groceries when considering both online and offline shopping behaviors together. While online grocery
baskets tend to be healthier compared to offline baskets, it is unclear if the adoption of OGS contributes to
healthier consumption or if it results in a redistribution across channels, where consumers simply shift the
more healthy purchases online and purchase unhealthy products mainly offline. More research is needed that
examines how households alternate between online and offline shopping trips and how they allocate their
purchases across both channels. As such, the central question in this project is:

*How does the transition to hybrid grocery shopping affect the healthiness of food purchases across both online
and offline grocery channels?*

The formal analysis examines how the healthiness of households’ grocery baskets changes once they start
shopping in online channels in addition to their in-store purchases. We will employ a Difference-in-Difference
(DiD) approach to compare the changes in healthiness of grocery baskets for households that transition to
hybrid shopping against those that continue shopping exclusively offline. This approach allows for controlling
for general trends that affect all households (e.g. COVID-19 pandemic). By using a DiD model, we can isolate
the effect that OGS has on the healthiness of households’ grocery food purchases.
